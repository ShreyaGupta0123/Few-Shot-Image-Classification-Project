# Few-Shot-Image-Classification-Project
This project implements a few-shot learning pipeline using OpenAI's CLIP model for feature extraction and FAISS for efficient similarity search. The pipeline classifies benign and malignant tumor images, integrates additional MedMNIST data for augmentation, and leverages Logistic Regression for final classification. The project includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization of retrieved images to demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented classification.
